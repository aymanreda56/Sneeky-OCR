# Sneeky-OCR
## This is a very simple bodged tool that helps me writing a lot of useless arabic letters efficiently. Combining easyocr, ar_corrector and a GUI.

### Function:
This tool just helps a little while writing numerous Arabic text taken from a non-editable (non-copyable) source, PDFs and photos for example.
It encapsulates a very simple OCR and another spelling corrector, then you take the output text and correct it further manually, and voila!

### Use Cases:
Can't think of any use case except mine which is pretty striaght forward, I am too lazy to write down the content of useless Arabic formal letters myself, so I made this tool just to assist me a little.

I write the content of useless letters like this, but a thousand times a day, pretty boring life :(
